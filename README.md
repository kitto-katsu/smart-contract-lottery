# RAFFLE CONTRACTS


## About

This code is to create proveably random smart contracts raffles.


## What does it do?

1. Users can join the lottery by buying a ticket.
    - Ticket fees will go to the winner
    
2. After X period of time a winner will be chosen.
    - The winner is automatically drawn
    - The winner is chosen programatically (random)
    - The lottery will be closed during the draw

3. Using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation.
    - Chainlink VRF ensures randomness when a winner is chosen
    - Chainlink Automation serves as a time based trigger
